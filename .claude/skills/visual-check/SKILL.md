# Visual check

Renders the real, built Electron app — not a mock — with a seeded config and
demo chat session, and screenshots it. Use this after making renderer/UI
changes to confirm what actually landed on screen, instead of guessing from
source alone.

## One-liner

```
powershell -File scripts/visual-check/run.ps1 -View chat
```

This builds the app, launches an isolated instance, waits for it to render,
screenshots it to `scripts/visual-check/visual-check.png`, and kills the
instance. Pass a different `-View` to land on a specific screen, `-OutFile
<path>` to change where the PNG goes, `-KeepOpen` to leave the instance
running for manual poking, or `-SkipBuild` to reuse the existing `out/`
bundle (much faster — use this if you haven't changed anything since the
last build, or already ran `npx electron-vite build` yourself).

Valid `-View` names: `chat`, `projects`, `agents`, `rooms`, `planner`,
`scheduled`, `usage`, `mcp`, `remote`.

## How it works

- `scripts/visual-check/launch.js` boots the built `out/main/index.js` with
  `app.setPath('userData', ...)` pointed at an isolated temp dir, then (if
  `VISUAL_CHECK_VIEW` is set) sends the same `app:open-view` IPC event the
  real app uses for plan-limit notification clicks, deep-linking to that view.
- `scripts/visual-check/seed/` holds a pre-built `config.json` (onboarding
  already marked done, dark theme) and a `sessions/demo.json` demo chat so
  the transcript isn't empty.
- `scripts/visual-check/run.ps1` copies the seed into a fresh temp userData
  dir, builds, launches `electron.exe scripts/visual-check/launch.js`, waits
  ~11s for render, calls `snap.ps1`, then kills the process.
- `scripts/visual-check/snap.ps1` grabs the process's `MainWindowHandle` and
  calls `PrintWindow(hwnd, hdc, 3)` (PW_RENDERFULLCONTENT) to capture it as a
  PNG — this works even if the window isn't focused or is behind other
  windows.

## Gotchas

- **Why isolation is required at all**: `npm run dev` instances share
  `%APPDATA%\claude-gui` userData and enforce a single-instance lock, so a
  second `npm run dev` just focuses the first window instead of starting
  fresh — you cannot visually check a change without either disrupting a
  running dev session or (this skill's approach) launching a separate
  instance from the built `out/` bundle with a redirected userData dir.
- **Seed JSON must be BOM-free UTF-8.** The app now tolerates a leading BOM
  (see `src/main/json-file.ts`), but don't take that as license to regenerate
  the seed files carelessly — PowerShell 5.1's `Set-Content`/`Out-File`
  default to UTF-8 **with** BOM, so if you ever rewrite
  `seed/config.json` or `seed/sessions/demo.json` from PowerShell, pass
  `-Encoding utf8NoBOM` or write them with Node/another BOM-free path
  instead. The checked-in seed files are already correct — just copy them
  as-is (`Copy-Item` preserves bytes untouched).
- **`PrintWindow` works without focus.** `snap.ps1` never clicks, focuses, or
  brings the window to front — it captures via a device context handle.
  Do **not** add synthetic mouse clicks or key presses to this flow: the
  app's frameless title bar has a large `-webkit-app-region: drag` area that
  swallows synthetic clicks, and a stray click/keystroke from the driving
  script can land on the *user's real windows* if focus ends up elsewhere.
  If you need to reach a specific screen, use `VISUAL_CHECK_VIEW` deep-linking
  (the `-View` param) instead of simulating navigation clicks.
- **A minimized/not-yet-shown window screenshots as ~160x28.** `snap.ps1`
  detects a degenerate rect (width < 300 or height < 200), calls
  `ShowWindow(hwnd, 9)` (SW_RESTORE), sleeps ~900ms, and re-measures before
  capturing — this is automatic, but if you still get a tiny image, the wait
  in `run.ps1` before capture (~11s) may need to be longer on a slow machine.
