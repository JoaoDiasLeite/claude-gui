# Next fixes — resolved

Follow-ups left open after the 0.6.0 multi-provider work (commits `56364c5`..`34b0c5c`).
All items below have shipped; kept as a record of what was wrong and how it was fixed.
Add new follow-ups above the line as they come up.

## Done

1. **Unbound Codex chats ran on the wrong account** — `App.tsx` passed
   `session.codexAccountId` with no fallback, so a chat that never had one set ran on the
   machine-default `CODEX_HOME`. Fixed by falling back to `codexDefaultAccountId` in the run
   payload and in the sidebar's `acctOf`, kept consistent by extracting both into
   `src/renderer/src/lib/account-scope.ts`. (`0ce43de`)

2. **No test for the scoping logic** — extracted `provOf`/`acctOf`/`idFor`/`visibleSessions`
   into `account-scope.ts` and added vitest (`npm test`) covering the four scoping cases,
   including the unbound-legacy-chat regression. (`0ce43de`)

3. **Provider account IPC accepted inert Gemini calls** — the mutating handlers now reject
   `provider === 'gemini'` (add throws; rename/remove/set-default no-op) and `loadGroup`
   drops any stored non-default Gemini accounts. (`4efa54a`)

4. **Stale comment about Gemini env isolation** — reworded `index.ts` to mention only
   `CODEX_HOME` and note Gemini's login is machine-wide in the OS keyring. (`4efa54a`)

5. **Model discovery only covered Codex** — added a best-effort Claude discovery source
   (`client.models.list()` when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set), run concurrently with Codex.
   Discovered ids render as "pricing not yet catalogued"; ids/pricing are never guessed.
   (`b96337c`)

6. **Renderer bundle was ~1.7 MB in one chunk** — measured, then lazy-loaded the secondary
   views + `ChatTerminal` and split the markdown/highlight stack into its own chunk. Entry
   chunk dropped to ~294 kB. (`f1c5726`)

## Follow-on work (surfaced while fixing the above)

- **Account picker only set the default, didn't switch the view** — with a chat from another
  provider active, picking an account left the row pinned to that provider. Picking now moves
  you onto the chosen account (recent chat there, else the active draft, else a fresh chat).
  (`e08d1c7`)

- **Codex plan-usage badge** — Codex exposes per-account usage via `codex app-server`'s
  `account/rateLimits/read`, so the sidebar `%` badge now works for Codex accounts too (see
  `src/main/codex-usage.ts`). Antigravity/Gemini has no per-account usage and stays badge-less.
  (`098433a`)

## Not doing

- **Multi-account Gemini.** Not possible: Antigravity's login is machine-wide in the OS
  keyring, not under a config dir, so there is nothing to isolate per account. The
  contradictory fake-HOME scaffolding was removed in `7021943`. Revisit only if Antigravity
  gains a config-dir override.
